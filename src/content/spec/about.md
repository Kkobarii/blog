# About This Blog

I created this blog after three months of just surviving, when I felt like I wasn't going anywhere. Of course, the cancer has a hand in that, even though I find it annoying to keep mentioning it. I told myself that if I have to go through this, I might as well document all these insights and feelings and create something useful from them. Most of all, I wish these thoughts could help someone going through something similar. I know how lonely one can feel in such a situation, and I myself would have appreciated a human source of knowledge when I was starting out.

I wouldn't want this to become just *My Cancer Blog*, so I hope I can come up with some topics that aren't related to it. But it's clear it will be the main theme, because I have a lot of things I want to write about. Hopefully, it won't be just depressing and tragic.

It was also important for me that the blog be multilingual. Czech is, of course, my first language, but with English, the posts can reach more people, and I'll also be able to share the blog with friends from Erasmus and the internet in general. I always write the posts in Czech and then translate them into English, adjusting any weirdness. Both versions should be equivalent and, I hope, similarly readable.

So, I hope my random thoughts and lightly structured ramblings will be useful for something.
