# My happy blog

I created this blog to share my thoughts, especially about my recent diagnosis, but hopefully about some other more diverse things later. I've always liked writing and this was a pretty good compromise between my current inability to code while still doing something productive to share with people.

The posts are written in Czech and translated and edited to English, so I can have the bilingual features of sharing with more people and all my non-Czech speaking friends. The dual language support is work of the best professional frontend programmer [@adaxiik](https://github.com/adaxiik).

The template I used is [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari), an amazing and free base for writing pretty and beautiful static blogs. Just what I needed.

## Jump right in if you dare

So, if you have some free time and want to read random thoughts of a girl whose life changed quickly and without warning (some may even say it got flipped, turned upside down), go over to **[blog.kkobari.eu](blog.kkobari.eu)**. Don't forget to change your preferred language (I recommend Czech if you can speak it, though the English versions are also good) and try to enjoy my ramblings!
